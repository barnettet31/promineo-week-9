## My process
First I started with a picture of what I wanted the page structure to look like. Here's a picture of that:

Then I layed out the basic HTML. Honestly this project was pretty easy again so I decided to add some fancy JS plugins as well as a special challenge for myself. 

So behold I have created a mortgage tracker that also uses a line graph to map out data for you over time! 

Oh also, you know I couldn't stop there! I have a serious problem. I added Jest for testing AND added typescript for type safety. 

Ya boi doesn't know how to take it easy y'all! 

### What I learned
I learned how to use both PrismJS and ChartJS in this project! Here's how I implemented those! 



```css 

```



```js
```
